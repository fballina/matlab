function [out1] = neighbor(v)
% takes as input a row vector called v and creates another row 
% vector as output that contains the absolve values of the 
% differences between neighboring elements of v. Check that 
% the input v is indeed a vector and has at least two 
% elements. Return an empty array otherwise. You are not 
% allowed to use the built-in function.
